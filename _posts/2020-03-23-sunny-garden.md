Title: Sunny Days in a Garden
published: true
---

The end of the world is no longer nigh but here. Coronavirus is sweeping across the planet, blithely crossing frontiers and sending governments into panic mode. It seems that viral infection has no respect for democratic values and those precious international treaties that guarantee freedom from the international  conflicts that plagued the first half of the 20th century. We are all confined to base. Grounded.

So I lounge  in a sunny garden in the south sast of France. Sending emails to Scotland, Japan, Paris and occsionally sharing a virtual verre de vin with a friend on social media. A break for lunch - roasted chicken, fried potatoes and mushrooms from the market with a couple of glasses of full bodied red. Feck me it’s a hard life.

Led Zepplin is on my phone piped (wirelessly of course) through to snug fitting noise cancelling earphones. My god this is hell. The March sun feels about as strong as the late summer sun in Scotland. And the songs remain the same, it takes me back to lazy days spent with my brother  sunning myselves in our parents garden to the sound of  Zepplin and the Doors.  We were students and we were free, carelessly so.

My parents are gone but the sun is just the same. Though at the end of the day it’ll go and hide over the Vercors mountains instead of the  rebrick terrace opposite. The Alps tower around me on all sides, steep walls of rock but the music takes me back beyond Coalburn  to lost valleys with rolling roads  meandering  towards the Clydeside. Beyond this the bleak moors rose up before the real hills, naked but for a speckling of sheep. You could be alone there for a time with just the birdsong and the wind. 

Ten years gone? When I listened to their tales of love lost and found I was but a child. Ten years then was forever and now it’s just a decade. So we’ll have ten long weeks in solitary this spring, confined in a fight to save something fuzzy and undefined. Our leaders can’t manage to declare war on rogue states preferring to obtain a piece of paper  from the United Nations. A vague commitment to rights and laws,  transformed into the instrument of their will. So I sit in the sun reaching out to my younger self, sharing the songs on my phone, and wondering how we will get fooled again.
