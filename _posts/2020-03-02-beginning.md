After many years of procrastination I'm blogging again.
Years spent playing with technology and cogitating. 
Contemplating the future and reflecting on the errors of the past.


What have I learned?

- Markdown
- Numpy and Pandas
- Notebooks
- virtual environments

What have I played with?

- laser cutters
- 3D printers
- Linux environments
- Colab and Jupyter
