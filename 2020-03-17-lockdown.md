Lockdown

Personally I have a very, very poor opinion of our leaders. Maybe before they were considered, and certainly considered themselves as politicians but in the New World Order they are leaders. Certainly not statesmen.

In the countries where I have lived for most of my life they invariably come from the “cast”. They look the same, employ pretty much the same rhetoric, they have been to the same schools, universities and, if they are not professional “politicians”, they have worked in the same cosy professional worlds. 

For nearly as long as I can remember these leaders have been at “war” with something or other. Voted the greatest person of the 20th century Churchill went to war as a soldier in WWI and  then as a combative Prime Minister in WWII led his people to triumph against a formidable enemy. Surely what succeeded for Sir Winston should work for our leaders now. They have waged all kind of combat -  beginning with the  cold war,  the wars against communism in Korea, Vietnam, South America, Afganistan, the war against drugs, the war against illiteracy, the war against terrorism, the war against cancer and now  the war against coronavirus. There is surely a branch of  metaphysics that explains the desire to be at war with whoever or whatever. Didn’t God give us in swift succession the universe, humanity, sin and conflict in just four chapters of Genesis ? 

Churchill’s enemies were real, physical entities. Later Thatcher  fought her wars against real people too - first against foreigners in a distant land then at home against the British left and the unions, twice celebrating a magnificent victory. Now our leaders seemingly promote threat  so that they too may taste the adulation that accompanies such triumph. Phoney wars with cartoon character villains.

Yesterday we all queued together docilely at the airport to be undressed, scanned, poked and otherwise physically violated by private security  in the war against terrorism.  Today we are all locked down separately so they can save those most fragile from certain death at the hands of a virus. For now our great leaders have declared war on a virus, a microscopic threat that will surely ravage...well I’m not sure what but they must act and act we will. They exhort us to make this last superhuman effort, to once more forsake the freedoms that Churchill defended, because even the loss of one human life is a tragedy. Unless of course if it is some foreign soul  in a distant kingdom forgotten by the ever watchful western media. For the urgency is a product of the media’s insatiable quest for relevancy in a 24/7 society. Our valliant leaders are transfixed and, and to break the spell we must be seen to be acting.


So what’s going to happen? Most probably a few will die but in the scheme of things not so many. Many, many will suffer financial hardship. Economically they have unleashed the demons imprisoned in Pandora’s box.
